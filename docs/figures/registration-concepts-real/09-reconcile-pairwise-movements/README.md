# Reconcile the pairwise movements

Claim: Slightly inconsistent pairwise displacements are solved together into one trajectory with the first frame fixed, so no single edge sets the answer.

- Grammar: trajectory with constraint overlay.
- Master: `fig/09-reconcile-pairwise-movements.png`.
- Producer: `python code/plot.py`.
- Exact plotted values: `data/der/figure_data.csv`.
- Source provenance: `data/sources.csv` and `data/sources.md`.
- Statistics: none reported; this figure states no inferential result.

Horizontal displacement above and vertical below, across all 240 frames. Each faint line is one measured frame pair, drawn from where the trajectory puts its first frame to where that pair alone would put its second; they disagree by small amounts and in every direction. The orange line is the single trajectory that fits all of them at once, anchored at the first frame. Right is how far each pair ended from that trajectory, with the median marked - the disagreement is spread across the graph rather than inherited from any one comparison.

## Where the numbers come from

Every value drawn here was measured by the project's own Python engine, `ripr`, on
position 1424 of the Auto-Organotypic demonstration set: 240 timepoints, four channels
(Bioluminescence, BF, RFP, GFP), 512 by 512 pixels at 2.0 um, half-hourly over five
days on an Olympus LV200. Registration is estimated on brightfield, as the
Auto-Organotypic demonstration does, because estimating on a signal channel lets the cells
register to themselves.

`data/src/run_registration_1424.py` ran the whole-recording multi-lag log-ratio
registration; `data/src/prep_intermediates.py` re-entered the engine to capture the
per-step intermediates this figure draws. Both are copied here with the engine
modules they call. The recording is identified by SHA256 in
`data/src/recording_provenance.json` rather than copied.

## Caveat

The set is deliberately text-free, so no axis, tile or marker carries a label; this
README is where each element is named.

Measured drift in this recording is small: about 4.0 pixels horizontally and
2.2 vertically across the whole five days. Where a true-to-scale arrow would
therefore be too small to see, it is drawn at an exaggeration that the caption above
states and `data/der/figure_data.csv` records. No image, mask, surface, trace or fit
is exaggerated - only arrows.
